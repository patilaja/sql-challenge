### Tasks:  

#### Data Modeling

#### Data Engineering

* Use the information you have to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. Specify data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints. 
* Be sure to create tables in the correct order to handle foreign keys.
* Import each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table.
